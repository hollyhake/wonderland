Figure 3.1: Accuracy and Response Time Across Lessons The graph in Figure shows the average accuracy and response time for each participant. Figure 3.2: Accuracy by Participant The graph in Figure is interactive. Hover over the data points to get a better look at the accuracy scores for each participant. Double click on a participant ID to isolate that participants data points. Figure 3.3: Accuracy by Clinical Status This graph in Figure separates the participants by clinical status. Figure 3.4: Response Time by Participant The graph in Figure is interactive. Hover over the data points to get a better look at the response times for each participant. Double click on a participant ID to isolate that participants data points. Figure 3.5: Response Time by Clinical Status 3.2 Rate of Forgetting 3.2.1 Mean Rate of Forgetting The mean Rate of Forgetting for each participant across all lessons. Figure 3.6: Rate of Forgetting Across Lessons Figure 3.7: Rate of Forgetting by Participant As you can see, individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCIs) tend to have a higher Rate of Forgetting than the age-matched controls. Figure 3.8: Rate of Forgetting by Clinical Status Figure 3.9: Rate of Forgetting by Clinical Status AS 3.2.2 Median Rate of Forgetting The median Rate of Forgetting for each participant across all lessons. Figure 3.10: Median Rate of Forgetting by Clinical Status AS 3.3 Distribution of Rate of Forgetting Figure 3.11: Distribution of Rate of Forgetting by Clinical Status Figure examines the distribution of ROF values for MCIs and controls, either across all sessions (A) or averaged across all sessions (B). 3.4 Classification accuracy 3.4.1 Single session How well can we tell patients from controls based on their ROF value from a single session? And now, we can visualize the ROC graph. First, we can compute the global AUC The global AUC is 0.8068391. Then, we can visualize the ROC curve and see the classification accuracy at each RoF threshold: Figure 3.12: Classification Accuracy for different RoF thresholds 3.4.2 Average of all sessions And now, we can visualize the ROC graph. First, we can compute the global AUC The global AUC is 0.8248889. Then, we can visualize the ROC curve and see the classification accuracy at each RoF threshold: Figure 3.13: Classification Accuracy for different averaged RoF thresholds "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
