This markdown file contains visualizations of Rates of Forgetting. 1.2 Background Memory loss is a debilitating symptom of neurodegenerative diseases. Current assessment tools, however, lack the reliable, convenient, and repeatable qualities needed to capture the individualized and evolving nature of memory decline. This project uses neurocomputational models to track and predict memory decline in subjectively- or mildly-cognitively impaired (MCI) individuals. MCI = Functional capacity is relatively intact, but on objective testing, show cognitive decline in at least one area of neuropsychological functioning. 1.3 Rate of Forgetting "],["methods.html", " 2 Methods 2.1 Participants 2.2 Memory Task", " 2 Methods 2.1 Participants 2.2 Memory Task "],["results.html", " 3 Results 3.1 Accuracy 3.2 Rate of Forgetting", " 3 Results ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;userId&#39;, &#39;lessonTitle&#39;, &#39;lessonId&#39;.

This graph lets you interact with the data points to get a better look at the accuracy scores for each of the individual subjects. This graph separates the subjects by clinical status. 3.2 Rate of Forgetting The averaged Rate of Forgetting for each participant across all lessons. ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_ydensity). ## Warning: position_dodge requires non-overlapping x intervals ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point). As you can see, individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCIs) tend to have a higher Rate of Forgetting than the age-matched controls. ## Warning: Computation failed in `stat_summary()`: "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
