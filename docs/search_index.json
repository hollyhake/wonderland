The biggest point of difference, whether single session or averaged sessions, is at an alpha of about #. The double bump in Figure A is likely due to differences in task difficulty. An interesting point here is that there are some things that are easier for the the MCI than for the controls (shown by that middle section overlap) and this makes it harder for the classifier. If we could build a classifier that has a general idea of difficulty (for instance, have the threshold for birds-which is an easier task- be 0.35 instead of 0.37), it would be much better. 3.6 Classification accuracy One of the most interesting questions which is, How diagnostic is the Rate of Forgetting? To analyze a parameters classification accuracy, you can plot an ROC curve. This curve will assess the sensitivity and specificity- two components that measure the inherent validity of a diagnostic test- of ROF as a diagnostic tool. First, we examined the ROC curve for just a single 8 minute session of data. Figure 3.14: Classification Accuracy for different RoF thresholds This figure visualizes the ROC curve to see the classification accuracy at each RoF threshold (fig 3.14). In this case, having a RoF value of 0.# as the diagnostic threshold- that is people with an RoF of 0.# and up are considered mildly cognitively impaired and people with an RoF less than are healthy controls- gives us a diagnostic classification accuracy of #%. All together though, the global AUC for single session is 0.7398039. Figure 3.15: Classification Accuracy for different averaged RoF thresholds This figure visualizes the ROC curve to see the classification accuracy at each RoF threshold (fig 3.15). The global AUC for averaged sessions is 0.7280719. 3.7 RoF Correlations Figure 3.16: RoF Test-Retest Reliability This figure visualizes the test-retest reliability of the RoF using correlations across materials (fig 3.16). The mean correlation is 0.928. .standings { font-family: Karla, \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 0.875rem; } .title { margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.125rem; font-size: 1rem; } .title h2 { font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; } .standings-table { margin-bottom: 1.25rem; } .header { border-bottom-color: #555; font-size: 0.8125rem; font-weight: 400; text-transform: uppercase; } /* Highlight headers when sorting */ .header:hover, .header[aria-sort=\"ascending\"], .header[aria-sort=\"descending\"] { background-color: #eee; } .border-left { border-left: 2px solid #555; } /* Use box-shadow to create row borders that appear behind vertical borders */ .cell { box-shadow: inset 0 -1px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15); } .group-last .cell { box-shadow: inset 0 -2px 0 #555; } .userId { display: flex; align-items: center; } .userId-icon { height: 1.3rem; border: 1px solid #f0f0f0; } .userId-name { margin-left: 0.5rem; font-size: 1.125rem; font-weight: 700; } .userId-record { margin-left: 0.35rem; color: hsl(0, 0%, 45%); font-size: 0.8125rem; } .group { font-size: 1.1875rem; } .number { font-family: \"Fira Mono\", Consolas, Monaco, monospace; font-size: 1rem; white-space: pre; } .TotalMeanAlpha-rating { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; margin: auto; width: 1.875rem; height: 1.875rem; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 50%; color: #000; font-size: 0.8125rem; letter-spacing: -1px; } "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
